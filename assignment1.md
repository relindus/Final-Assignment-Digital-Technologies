## Introduction
<p align="justify">
In today’s globalised world, technology permeates nearly every aspect of daily life — from waking up to the sound of a digital alarm to checking a smartphone before going to sleep. It is striking to think about the time when digital technologies were not present to the extent that they are now in higher education. When I started my academic career in the humanities in 2019, no one talked about artificial intelligence, let alone the usage of ChatGPT(OpenAI, 2025), since it had not been widespread yet. Students were expected to borrow the materials from the library or buy the books that were included in the syllabus. Bringing a personal computer to university was rarely necessary at that time. The only online library database I used was the JSTOR website(JSTOR, n.d.).The first year at university was when students learned how to write a proper academic text with proper citation on a computer. The students were still expected to print out their papers or having to make notes from a three-hundred-page book to be eligible to take an exam. In addition, exams were all in person and had to be done on paper. To think that only six years ago, that was the reality of Hungarian higher education, and what the reality is now is unusual, because now, hardly anyone is taking notes in notebooks and going to the library in person just to access materials included in the syllabus.

## Current digital technologies in Intercultural Studies and English
<p align="justify">
Intercultural Studies is a relatively recent and interdisciplinary field of research, not like the other degree I pursued before: English and American Studies. During the Intercultural Studies degree (the English track), the current digital technologies that are being used are library databases, artificial intelligence at times, and Microsoft tools such as Word or PowerPoint. Although it has not been used for my own research purposes, tools such as the Voyant Tools (Sinclear&Rockwell, 2016) could be increasingly useful in the field as well. <br>
Throughout the Applied Linguistics class during the English studies BA at Eötvös Lóránd University, students learn about corpus linguistics, which “…uses large collections of both spoken and written natural texts (corpora or corpuses, singular corpus) that are stored on computers.”(Schmitt & Rodgers, 2020) Through the use of various computer-assisted tools, corpus linguists are able to investigate a wide range of questions related to how language is used. (ibid.) During this course, a tool similar to the Voyant Tools(Sinclear&Rockwell, 2016) was used to analyse song lyrics as part of an assignment. Looking at the text of a specific song, one could make assumptions about the composer of the song based on the repeated words, etc. The following picture also shows a picture generated with one of the tools included in Voyant (Sinclear&Rockwell, 2016) based on a paper written last year for the class of Local Representation. The pdf had to be uploaded, and one of the features of the Voyant Tools (Sinclear&Rockwell, 2016) created a picture based on the most used words into a word cloud.

<p align="justify">
This semester at Aarhus University, Intercultural Studies majors have a class called Intercultural Projects in a Transnational World, where students have to conduct their own research and create their own empirical materials. Online interviews are being conducted where the researcher student records the conversation (with the consent of the informant) and then has to find a tool to transcribe it, as best as it can, and then most likely has to correct the mistakes the transcriber tool makes. Microsoft Teams is a platform where these interviews can be conducted; in addition, it has a live transcription feature, which is immensely useful for the researchers. Since the university is providing access to it, this is most likely the preferred way of conducting the interviews for the students and their informants, if in-person interviews are not a possibility.<br>
In the humanities, technology serves a particularly valuable role in facilitating research activities such as accessing library databases, conducting online interviews, transcribing speech, and analysing textual data. The immense benefit that technology gives to the humanities is that now one can access millions of written sources online, which saves a lot of time in terms of the habit of going to a library and browsing for sources for hours and reading every single paper, book, and publication that could be useful for our research. Now one finds material easier with the help of online library databases, and even in the sources found, if one is not sure where to start reading, they can easily just look up the topic by using the CTRL F shortcut. It saves time for the researcher, but without a doubt, it has its disadvantages. If one relies solely on online sources, it might be difficult for one to distinguish credible sources. Moreover, the convenience of online searches may sometimes discourage deeper engagement with texts, as researchers can be tempted to skim or rely on keyword searches instead of reading thoroughly.

## Introducing new technologies 
<p align="justify">
The most disruptive technology being introduced in the field of humanities is artificial intelligence. While it has its positive features, it does more harm than help in my opinion.  It makes people less cautious with credible information (as mentioned in the previous chapter as well), and in general, it could make people put less effort into projects they could easily do, but they assume artificial intelligence will help make their project better and easier to create.
 On the other hand, an example of a research in the humanities field showed how aritifical intelligence can be immensely helpful. Klamra et al.( 2023) conducted a study examining the potential of ChatGPT for translating texts from Middle Polish into modern Polish. In their research, ChatGPT was used to generate translations of archaic texts, which were then employed to train a neutral text-by-text model.  The authors warn of cautions, but according to their research, ChatGPT produced translations of generally good quality, thus indicating a high potential for large language models to be used in similar translation tasks. In this sense, artificial intelligence brings great potential to the humanities and their research field, but users definitely have to be careful and take caution when working with it. <br>
Thinking back to the COVID-19 lockdown, online teaching was also quite disruptive for some (although it is not solely the field of humanities that was affected by it, of course). Many courses had to change the exam requirements since no student was physically able to access books from the libraries that were required to be read, and most professors relied on the students’ library access, thus could not provide them with an online version of said material. <br>
Introducing students to platforms such as Zoom, Teams, Moodle, or Canvas was one issue to deal with, but most professors had a hard time creating material in the mentioned platforms or holding classes. Online classes were also less effective since students could easily get distracted in their own environments. Martindale et al (2024) introduce a term to describe this period as "emergency remote teaching". They argue that the online teaching that had to be implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic was nowhere near the "high-quality online education"(Martindale et al, 2024). For this reason, society has a low perception of online teaching in general, whereas according to Martindale et al(2024), there are studies to justify its success.

## Vital digital technologies for academics in humanities
<p align="justify">
As the whole world is connected through social media platforms, one could assume that more often than not, digital technology creates the space for intercultural communication, which is an important element of the field of intercultural studies. It can also create interest and motivation in one, to later pursue a career in the field. To be able to thrive in Intercultural Studies, it is vital to be able to use the basic tools used for writing text, such as Word or Google Docs, for example. I would say using a PowerPoint-type platform is also useful, since presenting and pitching ideas is part of the academic journey. To be able to conduct truly intercultural research in the field, it is definitely useful to be able to virtually be connected to the world, since the research data can be as thorough as the researcher wants it to be.  On the other hand, since the field is dealing with the humanities more specifically, cross-cultural experiences, I would say technically one could be successful in the field without digital technologies as well.<br>
In addition, as a student, it is vital to be aware of the platforms provided through our institution, such as in our case, Mitstudie, Brightspace, Wiseflow, and STADS. Without these platforms, one would not be able to access the materials provided to help us learn and grow in our field as students. If one were not able to use these digital platforms mentioned, they would fail to follow the course materials and later would not be able to participate in the exams either. The increasing dependence of students on digital technologies throughout their academic careers raises concerns about overreliance and the potential loss of traditional research skills even.

## Conclusion 
<p align="justify">
In conclusion, digital technologies have become very important in academic life in the humanities. Their integration has reshaped how research is conducted and how knowledge is shared. The accessibility of online databases, transcription tools, and communication platforms has made research faster and more collaborative, offering unprecedented opportunities for intercultural exchange and digital literacy. At the same time, this dependence on technology introduces challenges, such as the risk of superficial engagement with sources, unequal access to digital tools, and an overreliance on artificial intelligence. Therefore, while digitalisation has brought immense efficiency and inclusivity to the humanities, scholars need to maintain a critical approach — one that balances technological convenience with the reflective, analytical depth that defines the field. Ultimately, technology should be seen not as a replacement for traditional academic practices but as a complementary tool that, when used thoughtfully, can enhance and expand the possibilities of humanistic inquiry. <br>
