# Final Assignment Digital Technologies
Final hand in for Digital Technologies in the Humanitites class

This project is the end result of the 2025 Autumn Semester's Digital Technologies in the Humanities class. It is a website to showcase different assignments requested by the course teacher, such as a four page long essay about digital technologies in the field of the website's creator as well as a two page length description of the website design and some concluding thoughts on the outcome of the course.

This project was useful for a number of reasons. Due to the process of coding, skills have been acquired which are quite different from the "standard" skills people have in the field of humanities. Moreover, the result of the coding will always be a reminder on how to create a "beginner" level website. In addition the acquired skills can be developed in the future in the case of neccessity.

Users can interact with the project by visiting the website deployed to GitHub. Since it was only created for a university course the website will not be maintned nor refreshed any time in the future, and the only contributor is the owner of the website, who is also the person to turn to in case of concerns or questions.
